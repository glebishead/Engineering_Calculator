You can delete results.db. I wrote adapter which create new data base if results.db not exists.
Plotting_code is not optimal, because you can't find the exact value of roots. Expression is converting to an python expression.

When calculating trigonometric expressions, 
an inaccuracy occurs. This is due to the inability to determine the exact value of pi, we use rounding to 15 decimal places.
And also graph of some functions shows strange.
